 * function, and that it is called exactly once. The input to the function is

 * (MAX_THREAD_NUM). Each Thread should be allocated with a stack of size

 * (tid == 0) will result in the termination of the entire process using
 * exit(0) [after releasing the assigned library memory].

 * terminated and -1 otherwise. If a Thread terminates itself or the main
 * Thread is terminated, the function does not return.
